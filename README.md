## Health Data • Biostatistics • Machine Learning in Healthcare

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Aimen Faiz Rehman, a Data Scientist with a focus on health-tech data analysis and predictive modeling.

I’m particularly interested in risk and health prediction, and I enjoy applying statistical analysis and building models to solve real-world healthcare problems. My current work at TReNDS Research Center involves:

-Performing difference analyses

-Interpreting academic papers to draft logical arguments

-Creating brain maps using ICA on fMRI datasets

I have experience working with health datasets including:

-Breast cancer dataset (WHO) for logistic regression risk modeling

-fMRI sample dataset (GIFT Toolbox) for ICA brain mapping

Tech Stack 

Python 🐍 • R 📊 • SQL 🗄️ • Tableau 📈 • GIFT Toolbox 🧠 • FSL 🧪 • NumPy 🔢 • Pandas 🐼 • Matplotlib 📉 • Seaborn 🌊 • Scikit-Learn 🤖

Project Highlights

-Cold Start Recommender Systems: Ran a collaborative filtering algorithm and reduced the state space to improve results on a sample domain. This project strengthened my applied ML skills and innovation in feature engineering.

-Logistic Regression – Health Risk Prediction: Built models using the WHO breast cancer dataset to predict malignancy risk. Generated clear, interpretable results and developed a foundation for expanding into broader health risk prediction models.

-ICA / fMRI Brain Mapping: Conducted independent component analysis (ICA) on fMRI sample data using the GIFT Toolbox to create brain activity maps and interpret neural components.
